              Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of
              olive oil and once hot add the beef mince and a pinch of salt and
              pepper. Cook the mince until well browned over a medium-high heat
              (be careful not to burn the mince. It just needs to be a dark
              brown color). Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and set
              aside.

              Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the
              mince in and turn the heat to medium. Add the onions and a pinch
              of salt and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and
              translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add
              the grated carrot then pour the mince and any juices in the bowl
              back into the saucepan.

              Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Pour in the
              stock, bring to a simmer and then reduce the temperature to simmer
              gently for 45 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and rich. Taste
              and adjust the seasoning as necessary.

              When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water
              and add a pinch of salt. Cook according to the packet
              instructions. Once the spaghetti is cooked through, drain and add
              to the pan with the bolognese sauce. Mix well and serve.
